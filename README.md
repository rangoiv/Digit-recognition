# Digit-recognition


## Description
This is a simple algorithm for training neural network to recognize digits on [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
It is just an exercise on how to implement neural network by yourself. I followed closely

tutorial from 3b1b on YouTube, you probably heard of him, but if you haven't, he is awesome at explaining how this works, so check him out :).

I didn't use any fancy library for detecting images. The goal of the project was just to better understand how neural networks work from behind the hood. 
This is just the basic model, but it is sufficient to understand the basics.

## How to use

Just install c++ and run main.cpp.
You may change some constants as number of layers and number of neurons in each layer if you want and compare the results.
